    <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Shane Loewe and I am a sophomore at UNC studying Software Engineering.
        In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with celebrities and politicians (too many to list so don't ask me about
        them) and going
        to lavish events for the world's most wealthy. It's a hard job but somebody has to do it.
    <ul>When I'm not ducking the paparazzi or drinking Italian Sodas with Tom Hanks, you might find me...</ul>
    <li>Skateboarding</li>
    <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Listening to music</li>
    <li>Making some music</li>
