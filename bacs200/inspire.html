    <h1>My Hero</h1>
    <p>It's really hard for me to pick a public figure that I could really call my hero, not because there aren't
        incredible people
        in the world, but because I don't know any public figure personally enough to claim that they are my hero. But I
        think one person who
        has remained consistent throughout all his years in the public sphere, and someone whom I really admire for that
        reason is Bernie Sanders.
        I'm not a fan of idolizing politicians or idolizing people at all, but there is something very alluring about
        Sanders and his ability
        to remain consistent with his beliefs since he first entered the political landscape in the early 1980s, and
        before then in his own
        personal life. It's one thing for a politician to say or do something that makes themself look good when their
        under the scrutiny of
        the public eye, but Bernie Sanders was fighting for what he believed in long before he would break into
        politics.
    </p>
    <p>At the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the 60's, Sanders moved from Brooklyn to Chicago to fight for civil
        rights. He would
        go around putting flyers up all over Chicago, he was arrested by police during protests, he attended the March
        on Washington, and
        when he retires, there won't be any more Senators in Congress who were activists for black liberation during the
        Civil Rights Movement.
        And the interesting thing? Sanders refuses to talk about it. Bernie Sanders literally chained himself to black
        activists in the
        middle of Chicago in the 1960s to protest injustice, something most white people in the country at the time, and
        quite frankly right now
        wouldn't dare to do, kicked and screamed at the police as they came to arrest him for such acts, and he doesn't
        even talk about it.
        Sanders has never once used his admirable history to further his own political agenda. He is consistent in what
        he believes, even before
        anybody was even listening, and he continues to be consistent and influential to this day.

    </p>
    <p>For that reason, I think Bernie Sanders can be a hero for all people who believe in something, and I think his
        place in our
        government is important. Thank you for reading my piece about Bernie Sanders, the most consistent man in
        Congress.
