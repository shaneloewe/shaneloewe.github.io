                <h3>Wealth Inequality on the Rise in US</h3>
                <h6 style="color:rgba(175, 175, 175, 0.925)">by Shane Loewe</h6>
                <p>Right now, the political climate in America is tense. Amidst the global pandemic, political
                    polarization is at an all time
                    high and it is
                    difficult for us as a society to agree on anything, let alone our government leaders agreeing with
                    each other on
                    anything. Although, despite the polarization, there is one thing that is sure to scare any American,
                    or 95% of
                    Americans, rather. Income inequality in America has been rising steadily since the 1980’s and
                    doesn’t show any signs of
                    slowing down, this means that as working and middle class household income is decreasing or
                    remaining stagnant, the
                    wealthy keep getting wealthier. What are the implications of this?
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>As recent as 2020, the top 1% of households in the United States held fifteen times more wealth than
                    the bottom 50% of
                    households combined. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in America, makes $3,715 per second while 57% of
                    Americans are ONE
                    unexpected $500 expense away from falling into debt. Yet wildly, most of us aren’t thinking about
                    this in our day-to-day
                    lives, but perhaps we should: and not just working and middle class individuals, but the
                    upper-working class as well.</p>
