                <p class="card-text" style="text-align:left;">Hi there, my name is Shane Loewe and as part of a project
                    for my BACS200 web
                    development class, I'm here to tell you why
                    I would be a good candidate to hire for any project you're working on. So like I said, I’m Shane
                    Loewe. I'm from
                    Greeley, Colorado, the place some people are calling Silicon Valley 2. I’m studying Software
                    Engineering at the
                    University of Northern Colorado, which is my county’s Harvard. And I’m a good choice to hire for any
                    project because of
                    these 5 skills. So here are 5 of my skills. I'm well versed in java programming, python programming,
                    HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. I’ve completed several coding projects for my University studies, and I have good
                    knowledge of back-end
                    programming and algorithm structures. Those are my hard-skills, but nobody’s perfect, and I’ll be
                    the first to admit it.
                    I forgot to switch my laundry and then my clothes smell like mildew. Does that make me a failure?
                    No, but it does make
                    me smell. And I don’t want people thinking I smell, so I learned from that mistake. I don’t want
                    people thinking I’m bad
                    at what I do, either. So, if I don’t know something, or I mess up, know that I will learn and grow
                    from that experience
                    into the person you need. Because I'm going to mess up, but I can set aside my pride to ask for help
                    and learn from my
                    mistakes, unlike some of my competitors. I’m a hard worker, but talk is cheap. There’s not a thing
                    in my life I haven’t
                    worked hard at except not workin’ hard. The first job I ever interviewed for when I was 16, my car
                    wouldn’t start. So,
                    did I give up? No, I figured it out. I started walking to the interview and calling everybody that I
                    could to try to get
                    a ride to the interview, and I ended up making it there and landed the job.Communication. It’s the
                    backbone of society.
                    You think someone invented the wheel without talking about it with someone first? Since I was able
                    to work, I’ve been
                    putting in the hours at customer service jobs, learning how to talk to as many types of people as I
                    can to get stuff
                    done. And it was my passion for communication that led me to studying the Chinese language, as well
                    as some French and
                    German along the way. 我觉得中文会帮我. Perseverance and integrity. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve made
                    professional mistakes. I used
                    to work at a pizza place, and best believe if I messed up an order, the boss wasn’t too happy. But I
                    fessed up anytime
                    it ever happened. I take pride in everything I do, but I don’t have enough pride to prevent me from
                    being honest, with
                    my boss, with my clients, with my customers, and with myself. I could rattle on about programming
                    all I want, but I
                    wouldn’t be here applying if I didn’t know what I was doing. I have a great foundation of skills
                    that are ready to be
                    stretched and expanded upon. Not only that but I have a great network of incredible software
                    engineers and developers
                    within arms reach who would be willing to help me at any step of the way in your project.

                    Thank you
                </p>
