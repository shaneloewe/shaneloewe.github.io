                        <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                        <p>As recent as 2020, the top 1% of households in the United States held fifteen times more
                            wealth than the bottom 50% of
                            households combined. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in America, makes $3,715 per second while
                            57% of Americans are ONE
                            unexpected $500 expense away from falling into debt and 54% are living paycheck-to-paycheck.
                            If we make billionaires pay their fair share in taxes and
                            contribute back into society,
                            perhaps we can reduce poverty in America and allow those bottom 95% of Americans better
                            benefits such as healthcare and
                            housing.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                        <p>The economic implications of having a small majority of Americans holding a majority of the
                            wealth are huge in a way
                            that affects everybody else in America everyday without their knowledge. If the wealthy
                            minority has too much money,
                            then the rest of society is
                            left without the resources they need to engage in the economy, which leads to monopolies and
                            economic stagnation. If we
                            keep allowing this to happen, the 54% of Americans who are living paycheck-to-paycheck will
                            become even less secure than
                            they already are.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                        <p>Not only is society and the economy at risk by appeasing the ultra-wealthy in their
                            endeavours, but our democracy is at
                            risk as well, and some may even argue it has already been lost. Corruption in the government
                            shows its face in many
                            ways, and billionaires are wearing all of them. Investopedia in 2020 wrote that the
                            billionaire class has abused labor
                            through insufficient pay and work conditions and they have lobbied the federal government
                            for decades to not raise the
                            minimum wage with inflation. Unless we as a people put pressure on the government in a
                            meaningful way to combat this
                            kind of behavior, the
                            government will continue to sacrifice society’s and the economy’s well-being for this
                            wealthy minority.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>General Implications</h3>
                        <p>We have seen a trend that the needs of the middle and working class in America has
                            consistently been getting pushed to
                            the wayside in favor of ensuring a bright future for the ultra-wealthy in America. Most of
                            the nations aggregate income
                            is going towards wealthy households with the amount of aggregate income going to the
                            middle-class dropping from 61% to
                            51% since 1971 (a drop of 19%) and the amount of aggregate income going to the upper-class
                            rose 29% to 48%. The same
                            19%. This is a clear regression in economic equality, one that is hurting our society, our
                            economy, and our government.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">The Man for the Job</h5>
                <p class="card-text" style="text-align:left;">Hi there, my name is Shane Loewe and as part of a project
                    for my BACS200 web
                    development class, I'm here to tell you why
                    I would be a good candidate to hire for any project you're working on. So like I said, I’m Shane
                    Loewe. I'm from
                    Greeley, Colorado, the place some people are calling Silicon Valley 2. I’m studying Software
                    Engineering at the
                    University of Northern Colorado, which is my county’s Harvard. And I’m a good choice to hire for any
                    project because of
                    these 5 skills. So here are 5 of my skills. I'm well versed in java programming, python programming,
                    HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. I’ve completed several coding projects for my University studies, and I have good
                    knowledge of back-end
                    programming and algorithm structures. Those are my hard-skills, but nobody’s perfect, and I’ll be
                    the first to admit it.
                    I forgot to switch my laundry and then my clothes smell like mildew. Does that make me a failure?
                    No, but it does make
                    me smell. And I don’t want people thinking I smell, so I learned from that mistake. I don’t want
                    people thinking I’m bad
                    at what I do, either. So, if I don’t know something, or I mess up, know that I will learn and grow
                    from that experience
                    into the person you need. Because I'm going to mess up, but I can set aside my pride to ask for help
                    and learn from my
                    mistakes, unlike some of my competitors. I’m a hard worker, but talk is cheap. There’s not a thing
                    in my life I haven’t
                    worked hard at except not workin’ hard. The first job I ever interviewed for when I was 16, my car
                    wouldn’t start. So,
                    did I give up? No, I figured it out. I started walking to the interview and calling everybody that I
                    could to try to get
                    a ride to the interview, and I ended up making it there and landed the job.Communication. It’s the
                    backbone of society.
                    You think someone invented the wheel without talking about it with someone first? Since I was able
                    to work, I’ve been
                    putting in the hours at customer service jobs, learning how to talk to as many types of people as I
                    can to get stuff
                    done. And it was my passion for communication that led me to studying the Chinese language, as well
                    as some French and
                    German along the way. 我觉得中文会帮我. Perseverance and integrity. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve made
                    professional mistakes. I used
                    to work at a pizza place, and best believe if I messed up an order, the boss wasn’t too happy. But I
                    fessed up anytime
                    it ever happened. I take pride in everything I do, but I don’t have enough pride to prevent me from
                    being honest, with
                    my boss, with my clients, with my customers, and with myself. I could rattle on about programming
                    all I want, but I
                    wouldn’t be here applying if I didn’t know what I was doing. I have a great foundation of skills
                    that are ready to be
                    stretched and expanded upon. Not only that but I have a great network of incredible software
                    engineers and developers
                    within arms reach who would be willing to help me at any step of the way in your project.

                    Thank you
                </p>
