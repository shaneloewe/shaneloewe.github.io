                <h3>Wealth Inequality on the Rise in US</h3>
                <h6 style="color:rgba(175, 175, 175, 0.925)">by Shane Loewe</h6>
                <p>Right now, the political climate in America is tense. Amidst the global pandemic, political
                    polarization is at an all time
                    high and it is
                    difficult for us as a society to agree on anything, let alone our government leaders agreeing with
                    each other on
                    anything. Although, despite the polarization, there is one thing that is sure to scare any American,
                    or 95% of
                    Americans, rather. Income inequality in America has been rising steadily since the 1980’s and
                    doesn’t show any signs of
                    slowing down, this means that as working and middle class household income is decreasing or
                    remaining stagnant, the
                    wealthy keep getting wealthier. What are the implications of this?
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>As recent as 2020, the top 1% of households in the United States held fifteen times more wealth than
                    the bottom 50% of
                    households combined. Jeff Bezos, the richest man</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>in America, makes $3,715 per second while 57% of
                    Americans are ONE
                    unexpected $500 expense away from falling into debt. Yet wildly, most of us aren’t thinking about
                    this in our day-to-day
                    lives, but perhaps we should: and not just working and middle class individuals, but the
                    upper-working class as well. If
                    you make a $100,000 salary in the US, you are barely in the 50th percentile of wealth distribution.
                    The wealth increase
                    from the 50th to 80th percentile is about $400,000. But for perspective, the increase from the 80th
                    to the 100th
                    percentile is about $10,000,000. It is the ultra-wealthy billionaires, those households in the 5th
                    quintile, the 1% in this country that are going to
                    continue to use their money
                    to generate more money, a luxury those with less expendable or investable income don’t have. If we
                    make billionaires
                    pay their fair share in taxes and contribute back into society, perhaps we can reduce poverty in
                    America and allow those
                    bottom 95% of Americans better access to benefits such as healthcare and housing.</p>
                <h4>Economic Implications</h4>
                <p>The economic implications of having a small majority of Americans holding a majority of the wealth
                    are huge in a way
                    that affects everybody else in America everyday without their knowledge. You will hear some classic
                    economists argue
                    that a concentration of wealth in a minority of the population allows for economic growth, that if a
                    small minority of
                    people own a large sum of the wealth, they can make decisions to invest large sums into other
                    companies as well as grow
                    their own company which creates jobs and leads to economic stimulation. However, at what point do
                    the detriments of
                    having a wealthy minority outweigh the benefits? If the wealthy minority has too much money, then
                    the rest of society is
                    left without the resources they need to engage in the economy, which leads to monopolies and
                    economic stagnation. If we
                    keep allowing this to happen, the 54% of Americans who are living paycheck-to-paycheck will become
                    even less secure than
                    they already are.</p>
