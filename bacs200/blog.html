                <h3>Wealth Inequality on the Rise in US</h3>
                <h6 style="color:rgba(175, 175, 175, 0.925)">by Shane Loewe</h6>
                <p>Right now, the political climate in America is tense. Amidst the global pandemic, political
                    polarization is at an all time
                    high and it is
                    difficult for us as a society to agree on anything, let alone our government leaders agreeing with
                    each other on
                    anything. Although, despite the polarization, there is one thing that is sure to scare any American,
                    or 95% of
                    Americans, rather. Income inequality in America has been rising steadily since the 1980’s and
                    doesn’t show any signs of
                    slowing down, this means that as working and middle class household income is decreasing or
                    remaining stagnant, the
                    wealthy keep getting wealthier. What are the implications of this?
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>As recent as 2020, the top 1% of households in the United States held fifteen times more wealth than
                    the bottom 50% of
                    households combined. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in America, makes $3,715 per second while 57% of
                    Americans are ONE
                    unexpected $500 expense away from falling into debt. Yet wildly, most of us aren’t thinking about
                    this in our day-to-day
                    lives, but perhaps we should: and not just working and middle class individuals, but the
                    upper-working class as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>If you make a $100,000 salary in the US, you are barely in the 50th percentile of wealth
                    distribution.
                    The wealth increase
                    from the 50th to 80th percentile is about $400,000. But for perspective, the increase from the 80th
                    to the 100th
                    percentile is about $10,000,000. It is the ultra-wealthy billionaires, those households in the 5th
                    quintile, the 1% in this country that are going to
                    continue to use their money
                    to generate more money, a luxury those with less expendable or investable income don’t have. If we
                    make billionaires
                    pay their fair share in taxes and contribute back into society, perhaps we can reduce poverty in
                    America and allow those
                    bottom 95% of Americans better access to benefits such as healthcare and housing.</p>
                <h4>Economic Implications</h4>
                <p>The economic implications of having a small majority of Americans holding a majority of the wealth
                    are huge in a way
                    that affects everybody else in America everyday without their knowledge. You will hear some classic
                    economists argue
                    that a concentration of wealth in a minority of the population allows for economic growth, that if a
                    small minority of
                    people own a large sum of the wealth, they can make decisions to invest large sums into other
                    companies as well as grow
                    their own company which creates jobs and leads to economic stimulation. However, at what point do
                    the detriments of
                    having a wealthy </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>minority outweigh the benefits? If the wealthy minority has too much money, then
                    the rest of society is
                    left without the resources they need to engage in the economy, which leads to monopolies and
                    economic stagnation. If we
                    keep allowing this to happen, the 54% of Americans who are living paycheck-to-paycheck will become
                    even less secure than
                    they already are.</p>
                <h4>Political Implications</h4>
                <p>Not only is society and the economy at risk by appeasing the ultra-wealthy in their endeavours, but
                    our democracy is at
                    risk as well, and some may even argue it has already been lost. Corruption in the government shows
                    its face in many
                    ways, and billionaires are wearing all of them. Investopedia in 2020 wrote that the billionaire
                    class has abused labor
                    through insufficient pay and work conditions and they have lobbied the federal government for
                    decades to not raise the
                    minimum wage with inflation. This has caused Americans to be unable to support themselves on minimum
                    wage like they used
                    to. Unless we as a people put pressure on the government in a meaningful way to combat this kind of
                    behavior, the
                    government will continue to sacrifice society’s and the economy’s well-being for this wealthy
                    minority.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>We have seen a trend that the needs of the middle and working class in America has consistently been
                    getting pushed to
                    the wayside in favor of ensuring a bright future for the ultra-wealthy in America. Most of the
                    nations aggregate income
                    is going towards wealthy households with the amount of aggregate income going to the middle-class
                    dropping from 61% to
                    51% since 1971 (a drop of 19%) and the amount of aggregate income going to the upper-class rose 29%
                    to 48%. The same
                    19%. This is a clear regression in economic equality, one that is hurting our society, our economy,
                    and our government.</p>
