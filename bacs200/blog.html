                <h3>Wealth Inequality on the Rise in US</h3>
                <h6 style="color:rgba(175, 175, 175, 0.925)">by Shane Loewe</h6>
                <p>Right now, America is tense. Amidst the global pandemic, political polarization is at an all time
                    high and it is
                    difficult for us as a society to agree on anything, let alone our government leaders agreeing with
                    each other on
                    anything. Although, despite the polarization, there is one thing that is sure to scare any American,
                    or 95% of
                    Americans, rather. Income inequality in America has been rising steadily since the 1980’s and
                    doesn’t show any signs of
                    slowing down, this means that as working and middle class household income is decreasing or
                    remaining stagnant, the
                    wealthy keep getting wealthier.
